# Contributing
Thank you very much for wanting to contribute to this collection. Your help is very much appreciated. :tada: There are many ways to contribute (not only by adding or modifying code). You can:
* [Open issues](https://github.com/RARM/Codes-Collection/issues/new/choose) if:
	* A program is not working as expected.
	* There is a feature you want to add to a program.
	* There is a program you want to add, but you have not written the code.
	* There are typo's fixes or improvements to make in the documentation. This includes the list.md file that contains the titles and descriptions of the programs (short descriptions).
* [Pull request](https://github.com/RARM/Codes-Collection/compare) if:
	* There is a program you want to add, and you have already written the source code. Add your program to the respective C or C++ folder.
	* There are fixes for the documentation (typos).
	* There are improvements to make in the documentation. This includes the list.md file that contains the titles and descriptions of the programs (short descriptions).

These are just ideas and suggestions on how to help, but if you find another way to help, go for it!

Thank you once again for your contributions!
